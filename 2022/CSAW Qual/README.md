# CSAW Qual 2022
One year anniversary of CTF! Wow has it been a long year.
This is the first CTF I will revisit, but definitely not the last.

Our team ended up placing 62nd, and I was able to score over **3600 points** :partying_face: 
I ended up solving at least two challenges from each category except pwn (for obvious reasons),
but most of my efforts were spent on misc, rev, and crypto.

(ended up solving all crypto challs which is the first time I've solved everything in one category!)
(there's still an embargo currently but writeups will be released after that ends)
---
Anyways, I decided to write a good mix of writeups to hopefully help beginners understand some of the challenges.

Thanks for reading!
