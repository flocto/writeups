Collection of writeups for US Cyber Open 2022. 

Was a really fun solo contest, signed up at the last minute though (like always).
Ended up getting 26th, which I feel is pretty good.

Hopefully land that Combine spot though (Combine is the "invitational")

Anyways cheers and hope you enjoy the writeups.
