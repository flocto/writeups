## UIUCTF 2022
Super fun ctf, a lot of unique challenges. Managed to place at 29th, so pretty satisfied with my performance.

Overall challenges were a LOT tougher than other CTFs, almost no free points. (Okay obviously GCTF and DEFCON were harder but still)
Personally I didn't mind but I can see why some beginners would dislike it.

Ok sorry mini-rant over check out the 2 writeups thanks
